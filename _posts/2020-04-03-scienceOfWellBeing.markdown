During the quarantine, I spent some of my newfound time studying Laurie Santos's "The Science of Well-being" course on Coursera. I also listened to most episodes of her podcast, "The Happiness Lab," and combined notes for both learnings.

Some aspects of the course were cheesy and obvious at best -- of course curated social media feeds negatively affect people's self esteems. I, however, appreciated the interspersed concrete examples of ways that each person can measure the affects of lifestyle changes on day-to-day happiness.

I thought about applying the concepts learned to my communications with co-workers and clients.

Interesting takeaways:

1. From the podcast episode "Make Em Laugh"
    In person, our emotions are only affected by those whom we interact with on a regular basis-- usually family, friends, and co-workers.

    Online and in writing-- such as Facebook news feeds and news comment sections-- we naturally succumb to the emotions of people and bots we don't know.  It is a reminder to everyone to be aware of the affects of writing negative things, and to think of ways to be positive as well as re-frame our writings in the most positive ways possible.

    As applied to technical documentation, this an invitation to include encouragement within posts -- for example when a reader has made it halfway through a demo, add a "congrats" note.  Frame instructions in a positive light and do not include discouraging language such as "you should be able to understand this," etc.

2. From the course's lecture "Take Risks"
    When a person anticipates the affects of failure -- a bad grade, rejection, etc -- she expects that it will make her feel much worse than it does in reality.

    You can test this yourself. Rate your happiness then take a risk: check a grade, check rewards, open a letter. Then, rate your happiness again. Even if your risk's result wasn't as good as you were hoping, it is unlikely to change your overall happiness in as drastic of a way as you would anticipate.

    It is valuable to be open to taking educated risks and challenging yourself.  Failure isn't the worst possible outcome -- that is stagnance. 

3. From the course's lecture "Good Job"
    When people think about how they would ideally spend their free and weekend time, most think of leisure tasks like watching movies on Netflix. This newfound free time is especially relevant in the time of quaratine, as people eliminate commute times and close shops.

    While people are doing lazy tasks, they feel lazy, unhappy, and unproductive. In contrast, while people complete challenging tasks, people have flow and feel self-confident.

    Choosing "serious" leisure activities that utilize skill makes people happier. This is a reminder to spend less free time doing no-skill activities -- like binge watching TV -- and more time learning skills -- like completing puzzles, reading, cooking, and working out.
