Welcome to my blog! I plan to use this as a place to share about my journey as a developer and cool tech news. Enjoy!

```javascript
const Razorpay = require('razorpay');

let rzp = Razorpay({
	key_id: 'KEY_ID',
	secret: 'name'
});

// capture request
rzp.capture(payment_id, cost)
	.then(function (data) {
		return 2;
	})
```
